Having recently started a new project using [Love2D Framework](http://love2d.org), I felt the need to dispose of a camera system.<br/>
Actually, faking a camera system with __Love2D__ is [pretty dead simple](http://nova-fusion.com/2011/04/19/cameras-in-love2d-part-1-the-basics/), as its [API](https://love2d.org/wiki/Main_Page) already offers tools for that purpose.<br/>
So, instead of using an existing tool, I chose to write one from my own scratch.<br/>

Actually, it is a very simple module, which handles only translation on both X-axis and Y-axis.<br/>
There is no support for rotation, scaling, multiple layers as I did not need those features. I intend to have something *minimal*, remember ?<br/>

You can find it on [Github](http://yonaba.github.com/Love2d-Camera/). Use it as you like, as it is [MIT-Licensed](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php).<br/>
A very detailed __API documentation__ and __usage example__ are provided on the project page.
Feel free to __watch it__, __star it__ and/or __fork it__!
